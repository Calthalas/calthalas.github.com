This text contains no sense of shame.

####To the bikes...

...that we lost, that were stolen, that we forgot, chained to the lamposts, leaning more and more with each coming winter, with the tyres going flat. To the tyres themselves, flat, underpumped, old, new and destroyed. To the bikeshops that overcharge us and to the ones that don't.

####To the language...

...that is not yet German but is no longer English. To juts, schrippes and machbars. To Gergi and Gerglish and TÃ¼rlish and all the others that let us talk and not be forgotten.

####To the Wild West 
...to which few have gone and even fewer returned. To its shops and wide streets and high buildings that seem to us like from a different world and which we visit only occasionaly to revel and wonder. To the ones that live there, the strange creatures that we admire and pretend not to understand; and to us, who will, inevitably, move there at some point.

####To the bars
...of which we know where they are but do not remember the names. To the Smoky One with a Weird Owner; to the One That Is on Weserstrasse and Has Something To Do With Coal. To the One Where There Is Good Reisling But Bad Beer. To The One That Is In The Corner. To The One That They Closed Last Week.

####To the flats
...that we have and have not. To dingy rooms and overpriced holes, to great people and weirdos. To you, o leaking washmachine, and to you, o broken fridge that mercilessly rots all. To the great search that never ends and never begins, to the black mass of Besichtigungs during which we truly hate Our Fellow Man. To documents and forms. To all the flats that we wanted and never got and to the ones we inhabited and to all that happened in them.

####To the food
...to Mensas where we piled salads, poured sauces and stuffed ourselves with potatoes, pretending to be still students, with forged IDs. To the One Indian Restaurant that Finally Serves Real Good Indian Food that doesn't exist and will never exist, but which we seek. To Imren Grill, in the night, at 4 AM, where we ate Linsensuppe and talked politics while the city was waking up. To the markets that are full of wonders and fiveadays and to which we say we go, but actually do not go that often.

####To the weather
...that is neverver right and always contrary to the forecast. To the stuffy summers that are never there and when they are you can't stand them and to the wet winters (and in particular, to you, Winter of 2013[^1], which everybody remembers but each of us differently, although three things are certain: there was snow, S-bahn was not working and it was minus million).

####To the Ubahn
...that [smells just right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEhg0J_COiQ) when you come home after a long journey and you know that this is indeed home. To its windy tunnels and simple stations, to the weirdos that live in it. To all those moments when we thought that we can achieve nothing in our lives and we went schwarzfahren, succeeded and felt the excitement and sense of victory once again.

####To the ugliness
...for verily Berlin is ugly. It is dark and twisted and forgives no one. It is too hot in the summer, too cold in the winter. It is dark and gloomy and exists in a perpetual state of unfulfilled deathwish. So here is to the lost chances and grandiose ambitions that we share with the city that never finishes the race, always tries and always gives up, lights a cigarette, drinks a beer and ten minutes later, with a grin of a madman, plunges into yet another impossible idea. To all the U10s and 200 km Plans, may we always have them and never fulfill them.

####To the ones that we lost
...who didn't make it, who left the city and are now out there, looking for their new Berlins. And to the ones that return from time to time and ask questions and care and presume we are gonna leave soon, but know that we won't. To them also be our thanks.

####Thanks be also for other things.

For a chance to have our firsts once again.

For the time wrap in which we pernamently live, punctuated neatly by the Four Seasons of Berlin: When I Find a Job, When I Get a Flat, When I Fix My Bike and When I Fill In That Form.

And thank you, God, that you have left Berlin alone and that you have forgotten it. Thus we are left to our own devices and we can worship little deities of Ubahns and parks and derelict buildings. For to live in Berlin is, indeed, to take a vacation from heaven. For that also be our thanks.

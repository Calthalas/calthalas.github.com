###Of Converts

Guardian published an [article](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/03/george-rr-martin-game-of-thrones-and-the-triumph-of-fantasy-fiction) about how fantasy is entering mainstream. Frankly speaking I can't even bear anymore the self-professed "converts" (who, in 9 out of 10 cases, converted after watching Game of Thrones), but the need to include rather than exclude fantasy is, as a phenomenon, fascinating in itself. And I'm really happy about it!

###Of Writers Lost

Recently we lost Terry Pratchett. A writer, who managed to become an actual friend of milions of readers around the world and (damn) this is not even a clich√©. People (including yours truly) were able to turn to his books and find not only entertainment but solace. He achieved that not through easy moralising or dishing out universal truths but through a complicated and morally ambigious (and unstable) world that, at the same time, was extremely funny.

When he died everybody was, if not a believer, then an instant convert. Yet his work has been criticised in the past and the praise seemed to come mostly from the fact that although he wrote fantasy there was **something more to it**.

Sure there was! But that is not the point. Terry Pratchett was, first and foremost, a fantasy writer. He was always very [clear](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/22/terry-pratchett-raising-steam) about it. He was also a satiricist and a science writer and a politcal commentator and social one and many many more. But he did that through fantasy. A genre that always has to be **something more** to have a legitimate space on the bookshelf.

### Onwards and Upwards

This is not to say that fantasy is deemed to be the bastard child of literature forever. It is having its heyday if not in quality then at least in the public space (now everybody wants to be a fantasy writer! E.g. Kazuo Ishiguro's *The Buried Giant* [^1]). And while I might be a bit sad about the **method** in which fantasy starts to take cultural space by the storm (I tend to fall asleep on GoT episodes) I am very happy that it does. It is, when you look at it, the oldest of ways of telling a story.

title: Looking for a flat
---
[Auf Deutsch](/flat_de)

##Hey!

This is Mat.

He is nice, in his late twenties, works as a translator, likes to cook and doesn't say no to a beer or two.

The thing is...

####He is looking for a flat!

In Berlin!

And urgently. Can you help Mat? If you can help him find a flat he will bake you a cake! (Not just a virtual one, a real cake - of your choice or you can just let him surprise you!)

Here are some details:

* Mat is looking for a studio flat OR a nice WG room
* He is able (and willing!) to pay 450-470 euro top (sadly, apart from living in the awesome flat that you will help him find, he also has to spend money on other things)
* Preferable districts are Kreuzberg, Neukölln, Tempelhof, but hey! anything nice and awesome works
* He has the holy trinity of documents readily availible: SCHUFA, payslips and even the Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung!

Can you help Mat? Please write to:
